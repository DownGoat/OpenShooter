//KNOWN BUGS
* Audio library makes the game appear to be crashed in Windows
* Acceleration is not implemented properly, so the plane feels static and boring
* When clicking on the menu, you perform one click per frame, so you click 60 times per second, 
  which can lead to clicking through a whole menu if the different menus have buttons on the same place.
  
//TODO GAME
* Content, content and content
* The game is boring, and need more animations and sprites, plus fresher menus.
* Adjustment to sound-effects, it's loud and boring right now.
* Settings-menu where you can change resolution (This also mean that we need higher resolution background
  and sprite-scaling).
* More Touhou-ish shooting, not boring and small bullets, but a spray of colourful lasers.
* Animations to plane, tilting and jet-flames.
* Enemies, at least some basic enemies.
* Proper stages/levels and scrolling backgrounds with grid-system.
* Fully functional menus, where you can escape yourself back, and where you can set difficulties,
  system-settings and shit.
* Implement background-music, which is open and released under a non-commercial licence.
* Make the ability to 'throw' bullets, and randomise the bullet-Xvelocity a bit
* MAKE A PUBLIC RELEASE, AND LIVE UP TO THE NAME 'OPEN'
